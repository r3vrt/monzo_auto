# üöÄ Autosorter Trigger Enhancements

This document summarizes the enhanced autosorter trigger system that was implemented to provide more flexible and powerful automation capabilities.

## üìã Overview

The autosorter system has been enhanced with multiple trigger types, allowing for more sophisticated automation rules that can respond to different conditions and time patterns.

## üéØ New Trigger Types

### 1. Time of Day Trigger
**Purpose**: Execute autosorter at a specific time on a specific day of the month.

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "trigger_type": "time_of_day",
  "time_of_day_trigger": {
    "day_of_month": 25,
    "hour": 9,
    "minute": 0
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Execute money distribution at 9:00 AM on payday
- Run automation at specific times when you're available
- Coordinate with other financial activities

**Example**: "Morning Money Distribution (9 AM)" - Executes on the 25th at 9:00 AM

### 2. Transaction-Based Trigger
**Purpose**: Execute autosorter when a specific transaction pattern is detected.

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "trigger_type": "transaction_based",
  "transaction_trigger": {
    "description_pattern": "SALARY",
    "amount_min": 100000,
    "amount_max": null,
    "category": null,
    "merchant": null,
    "days_to_look_back": 3
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Trigger when salary is received
- Respond to specific income sources
- React to large transactions

**Example**: "Salary-Based Money Distribution" - Executes when a transaction with "SALARY" in the description and amount ‚â• ¬£1000 is detected

### 3. Date Range Trigger
**Purpose**: Execute autosorter within a range of days in the month.

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "trigger_type": "date_range",
  "date_range_trigger": {
    "start_day": 25,
    "end_day": 27,
    "preferred_hour": 10,
    "preferred_minute": 30
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Flexible payday handling (payday might vary)
- Weekend-friendly execution
- Account for month-end variations

**Example**: "Flexible Payday Distribution (25th-27th)" - Executes between the 25th and 27th of each month

### 4. Legacy Payday Date Trigger
**Purpose**: Execute autosorter on a specific day of the month (backward compatibility).

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "trigger_type": "payday_date",
  "payday_date": 25
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Simple monthly automation
- Fixed payday schedules
- Legacy rule compatibility

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Configuration Schema

The `AutosorterConfig` dataclass has been enhanced with:

```python
@dataclass
class AutosorterConfig:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Enhanced trigger configuration
    trigger_type: TriggerType = TriggerType.PAYDAY_DATE
    payday_date: int = 25  # Legacy support
    time_of_day_trigger: Optional[TimeOfDayTrigger] = None
    transaction_trigger: Optional[TransactionTrigger] = None
    date_range_trigger: Optional[DateRangeTrigger] = None
```

### Trigger Validation

Comprehensive validation ensures:
- Valid day ranges (1-31)
- Valid time ranges (0-23 hours, 0-59 minutes)
- Required fields for each trigger type
- Performance warnings for large lookback periods

### Integration Layer

The automation integration layer has been updated to:
- Parse enhanced trigger configurations
- Validate configurations before execution
- Use the new trigger checking logic
- Maintain backward compatibility

## üß™ Testing

A comprehensive test suite validates:
- Configuration validation for all trigger types
- Trigger logic with current date/time
- Example configurations from setup script
- Error handling and edge cases

Run tests with:
```bash
python test_autosorter_triggers.py
```

## üìä Example Rules Created

The setup script now creates 8 example automation rules:

1. **Payday Pot Sweep (Enhanced)** - Enhanced pot sweep with payday detection
2. **Monthly Bills Sweep (Legacy)** - Fixed monthly transfer (disabled)
3. **Intelligent Money Distribution** - Legacy payday-based distribution
4. **Morning Money Distribution (9 AM)** - Time-based trigger on 25th at 9:00 AM
5. **Salary-Based Money Distribution** - Transaction-based trigger when salary is received
6. **Flexible Payday Distribution (25th-27th)** - Date range trigger with preferred time
7. **Weekly Savings Topup** - Weekly transfer to savings pot
8. **Bills Pot Analysis** - Analyzes bills spending patterns

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

All existing autosorter rules continue to work without modification:
- Legacy `payday_date` configuration is automatically converted
- Existing rules use `TriggerType.PAYDAY_DATE` by default
- No database migrations required

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Creating a Time-Based Rule
```python
config = {
    "trigger_type": "time_of_day",
    "time_of_day_trigger": {
        "day_of_month": 25,
        "hour": 9,
        "minute": 0
    },
    "holding_pot_id": "pot_123",
    "bills_pot_id": "pot_456",
    # ... other configuration
}
```

### Creating a Transaction-Based Rule
```python
config = {
    "trigger_type": "transaction_based",
    "transaction_trigger": {
        "description_pattern": "SALARY",
        "amount_min": 100000,
        "days_to_look_back": 3
    },
    "holding_pot_id": "pot_123",
    "bills_pot_id": "pot_456",
    # ... other configuration
}
```

### Creating a Date Range Rule
```python
config = {
    "trigger_type": "date_range",
    "date_range_trigger": {
        "start_day": 25,
        "end_day": 27,
        "preferred_hour": 10,
        "preferred_minute": 30
    },
    "holding_pot_id": "pot_123",
    "bills_pot_id": "pot_456",
    # ... other configuration
}
```

## üìà Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Multiple trigger types for different use cases
2. **Reliability**: Transaction-based triggers respond to actual events
3. **Convenience**: Time-based triggers work around your schedule
4. **Robustness**: Date range triggers handle payday variations
5. **Compatibility**: Existing rules continue to work unchanged

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Weekly trigger patterns
- Multiple trigger conditions (AND/OR logic)
- Custom trigger functions
- Trigger chaining (one rule triggers another)
- Webhook-based triggers

## üìù Migration Guide

For existing users:
1. No action required - existing rules continue to work
2. New trigger types are available for new rules
3. Existing rules can be updated to use new triggers if desired
4. All validation and testing tools are available
